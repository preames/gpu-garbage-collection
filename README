This repository holds the code that was written in support of the ISMM 2012 paper: "GPUs as an Opportunity for Offloading Garbage Collection" by Martin Maas, Philip Reames, Jeffrey Morlan, Krste Asanovi, Anthony D. Joseph, and John Kubiatowicz from the University of California Berkeley.  Unless you've read that paper, this code release will probably not be much use to you.

Note on Project Status: This is a snapshot of work that we are continuing and hope to publish further on.  If you're interested in collaborating, please email one of the authors.  There will likely be future code snapshots released.

Note on Code Quality: Be aware that this repository is a snapshot of *research project*.  Research code is not production code.  There are known (and probably unknown) bugs in this code.  We go to great effort to preserve flexibility that is not useful outside of the paper above.  This code works on exactly one hardware platform.  Porting it to another platform will most likely involve fixing assumptions we made that don't apply to your new platform and working around hardware bugs.  (We work around at least one known hardware bug.)

IMPORTANT Note on Licensing: The code in this repository comes from a number of sources with different (and potentially incompatible) licensing.  The majority of the code comes directly from the Jikes RVM project which is open source.  All of the code written by us is available under a BSD 3-clause licence.  However, at various points in the project history, there has been code from other sources in the repository with non-open source licenses.  When releasing this, we've done our best to strip that code out and merely link to where we got it.  However, we can not guarantee we got everything.  If you're using this for research, you probably don't care too much, but you should be aware.
